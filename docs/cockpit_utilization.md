## Skillbuilding
- **Daily PM Updates**: Log updates in PM: Execution thread.
- **OPS Threads**: Use for scratchpad / live triage.
- **DELI Threads**: Each deliverable = dedicated thread.

## Cadence
- **Morning**: Tactical triage (bOPS).
- **Weekly**: Roadmap review (move modules between Queued/Planned/Tentative).
- **Monthly**: Principles.md audit (check adherence).

## Use Cases
- **Clinical Automation**
  - Client reminders, session summaries, forms.
- **Consulting Automation**
  - White papers, structured reviews, external deliverables.
- **Personal Automation**
  - Fitness logging, family health dashboards.

## Example Flow
1. Client session → DV row updated.
2. Trigger → Reminder system queue.
3. Reminder sent → Logged in Action Log.
4. AI summary triggered → Draft into DV rich text.
5. PM: Execution updated with runID + outputs.

## Philosophy
- The cockpit = **single source of truth**.
- Cursor = coding environment.
- ChatGPT = orchestration + reasoning partner.
- Excel/DV = backend + state.
- OPS/PM/DELI threads = project layer.

## Notes
- This document = usage norms, not technical architecture.
- Living doc: update as habits and patterns evolve.
