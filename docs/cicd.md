# Life Cockpit CI/CD Strategy

**Minimal Viable to Ultimate Compliance Pipeline**

Life Cockpit implements a dual-track CI/CD strategy: **Minimal Viable CI/CD** for immediate tinkering safety, and **Ultimate CI/CD** for hospital-grade compliance.

## üéØ **Dual-Track Strategy**

### **Core Principle**
- **One Repository** - Single codebase for all environments
- **Classification-Based** - Policy packs determine security requirements
- **Velocity + Safety** - Fast tinkering with safety guardrails
- **Scalable Compliance** - Evolve from minimal to hospital-grade

### **Classification Policy Packs**
- **Personal** ‚Üí Light, fast, tinkering-friendly
- **Business** ‚Üí Moderate (audit + single approval)
- **Clinical** ‚Üí Strict (full HIPAA/PHIPA, dual control, DLP, audit)

## ‚ö° **Minimal Viable CI/CD (MVP)**

### **Goal: Tinker Safely This Week**
Enable immediate automation with safety guardrails, confined to dev/staging environments.

### **Key Features**
- **Local Sandbox Mode** - Mock services for fast development
- **Dry-Run Default** - All operations safe by default
- **Run Logging** - Every execution tracked in staging Dataverse
- **Single Pipeline** - Simple GitHub Actions workflow
- **No Production Writes** - Production blocked at code + pipeline

### **Pipeline Stages**

#### **1. Local Development**
```bash
# Local sandbox with mock services
export BLC_LOCAL=true
python blc.py --dry-run client-report generate

# Safe execution with approval
python blc.py --approve --run-id=123 client-report generate
```

#### **2. CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml

  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:

      with:
        python-version: '3.12'
    - name: Install dependencies

  deploy-staging:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [test, security]
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
    environment: staging
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Deploy to staging
      run: |
        echo "Deploying to staging environment"
        # Add staging deployment logic here
    - name: Run integration tests
      run: |
        echo "Running integration tests against staging"
        # Add integration test logic here
```

#### **3. Staging Environment**
- **Synthetic Data** - Real APIs with test data
- **Full Audit Logging** - Every operation tracked
- **Integration Testing** - End-to-end workflow validation
- **Preview Environments** - Ephemeral staging per PR

#### **4. Safety Guardrails**
- **Dry-Run Default** - All operations show what they would do
- **Approval Required** - `--approve` flag for any writes
- **Run ID Tracking** - Every operation has unique identifier
- **Classification Enforcement** - Operations checked against classification

### **MVP Success Criteria**
- ‚úÖ **Tinker Safely** - Can experiment without risk
- ‚úÖ **Fast Iteration** - Quick development cycles
- ‚úÖ **Safety Guardrails** - Prevents accidental damage
- ‚úÖ **Audit Trail** - Track all operations
- ‚úÖ **No Production Risk** - Production protected

## üè• **Ultimate CI/CD (Hospital-Grade)**

### **Goal: Impress a Regulator Review**

  compliance:
    # HIPAA/PHIPA compliance checks
  security:
    # SAST, DAST, dependency scanning
  quality:
    # Code quality, performance, accessibility
```

#### **Staging CD (release/*)**

## üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Mechanisms**

### **Dry-Run Default**
```bash
# All operations show what they would do
python blc.py client-report generate
# Output: "Would generate report for client 123 (DRY RUN)"

# Explicit approval required for actual execution
python blc.py --approve --run-id=456 client-report generate
# Output: "Generating report for client 123 (APPROVED)"
```

### **Run ID Tracking**
```bash
# Every operation gets a unique identifier
python blc.py --run-id=789 session-summary generate
# Logged: "Run ID 789: session-summary generate - STARTED"
# Logged: "Run ID 789: session-summary generate - COMPLETED"
```

### **Classification Enforcement**
```bash
# Personal operations - no approval needed
python blc.py --classification=personal household-task create

# Business operations - single approval
python blc.py --classification=business --approve billing-process run

# Clinical operations - dual approval
python blc.py --classification=clinical --approve --clinical session-note create
```
