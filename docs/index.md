# Life Cockpit Documentation

**Your Personal Programmatic Life Management System**

Welcome to Life Cockpit - YOUR personal automation system built by you, for you, to organize and energize YOUR life. This is not a product for others - it's YOUR tool for managing YOUR life programmatically.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

Life Cockpit is designed around YOUR needs, YOUR patterns, YOUR goals. Every feature, every workflow, every automation is built for YOU. While we build with modularity and the future in mind (some components may be spun off as public services), the core principle is that this is YOUR system for YOUR life.
