# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This document contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Life Cockpit project. ADRs are short text documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of the project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context, consequences, and rationale.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this format:

- **Title**: A short descriptive title
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The problem being addressed
- **Decision**: The decision that was made
- **Consequences**: The resulting context after applying the decision
- **Alternatives**: Other options that were considered
